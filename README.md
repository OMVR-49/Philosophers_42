# Philosophers 42

The Philosophers project at 42 is a classic synchronization and concurrency challenge that involves solving the dining philosophers problem. The project is designed to test a student's understanding of parallel programming, inter-process communication, multi-threads concept, and synchronization techniques.

The Philosophers project involves solving the dining philosophers problem, a classic synchronization and concurrency problem. The goal is to implement a program that simulates the dining philosophers scenario and ensures that they can eat without conflicts.


## Usage

```bash
make
./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep]
([number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]) optional argument
